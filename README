QuickTicket
===========

QuickTicket is a Rails plugin that utilizes the Lighthouse API to provide ticket
creation within a Rails application. This will create a little icon on the
bottom right of the application screen (which scrolls) that will display a pane
when clicked. This will allow the user to provide their comments/issues/bug into 
the pane which is then submitted to your Lighthouse account for the project.
