QuickTicket
===========

QuickTicket is a Rails plugin that utilizes the Lighthouse API to provide ticket
creation within a Rails application. This will create a little icon on the
bottom right of the application screen (which scrolls) that will display a pane
when clicked. This will allow the user to provide their comments/issues/bug into 
the pane which is then submitted to your Lighthouse account for the project.

How to use
==========

Once you have the plugin installed, you will have to add the following settings 
into your environment.rb file. This will allow the plugin to connect to your 
Lighthouse account and load tickets only in the environments you specify.


IterativeDesigns::QuickTicket.account = "iterativedesigns"		
#replace with your account name (first part of the domain name for Lighthouse)

IterativeDesigns::QuickTicket::token   = "YOUR LIGHTHOUSE GENERATED TOKEN"

IterativeDesigns::QuickTicket::project = 1234					
# You can find this through your URL

IterativeDesigns::QuickTicket::site_name = "SPECIAL_SITE.com"	
# The name of your application to make it feel localized, leave blank if you 
# don't care.

IterativeDesigns::QuickTicket::environments = ['development']	
# The environments you want your QuickTicket to show up in, list as many or 
# as few as you want.
